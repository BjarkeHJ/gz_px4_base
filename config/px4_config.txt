How to config the GT odometry data feed:
Navigate to:
~/PX4-Autopilot/ROMFS/px4mu_common/init.d-posix/airframes/4001_gz_x500

at the bottom of the file copy in the following:

# --- CUSTOMIZE --- 
param set EKF2_EV_CTRL 11
param set EKF2_HGT_REF 3
param set EKF2_BARO_CTRL 0
param set EKF2_GPS_CTRL 0
param set EKF2_RNG_CTRL 0
param set SYS_HAS_MAG 0
param set NAV_DLL_ACT 0
param set UXRCE_DDS_SYNCT 0

In a terminal navigate to:
~/PX4-Autopilot

and run
make all 

to enable the changes.
Now the GT odometry data from gz sim is feed back into the PX4 flight stack and fused with the IMU alone. 
Thi simulates near-perfect on-board odometry for easier algorithm development (cm precision atleast)
